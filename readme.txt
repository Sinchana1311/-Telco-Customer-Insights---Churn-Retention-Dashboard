Key Dashboard Views & Insights

Home Page – Guided Navigation
 The Home page is structured around key business questions such as why customers churn, who they are, what services they use, and what account types they have. Interactive GIF-based buttons guide users to detailed pages on churn trends, customer insights, service analysis, and account analysis, enabling smooth and intuitive navigation across the dashboard.

Churn Overview
 Get a high-level snapshot of churn health with KPIs such as total customers, churn rate, active customers, and revenue at risk. Identify high-risk segments and overall churn trends at a glance.

Customer Profile Analysis
 Analyze churn behavior across demographics such as gender, senior citizenship, tenure groups, and support usage. Understand who is churning and why through behavioral and demographic patterns.

Services & Contract Analysis
